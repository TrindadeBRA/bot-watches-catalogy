Whether running, walking or working out, this essential gear features a high-definition Memory in Pixel (MIP) LCD for a high-visibility, easy read wherever you are. Authentic fitness and health goes along with caring about the environment, too. That’s why we’ve made the bezel and band from bio-based resin.

These multi-sport watches come packed with functions for tracking all kinds of workouts. Measure your heart rate with the optical sensor and use the accelerometer to count steps. You can tap into the PolarTM smartwatch library to analyze workouts, track post-sleep recovery, and support breathing exercises — even use the oximeter to measure blood oxygen levels. Whether running, walking or working out, this essential gear features a high-definition Memory in Pixel (MIP) LCD for a high-visibility, easy read wherever you are. Authentic fitness and health goes along with caring about the environment, too. That’s why we’ve made the bezel and band from bio-based resin. Produced from renewable organic materials, biomass plastics are high-molecular, chemically or biologically synthesized materials that help reduce environmental impact and shift the world closer to a circular economy. Charge with either USB or solar, and you’ll always stay on your game. ＊The PolarTM word mark and logos are registered trademarks owned by Polar Electro Oy."

    "watch_description": "The G-SHOCK Ref. 6900 - Subtract by Ed Sheeran is inspired by the album artwork for Sheeran’s latest album, Subtract. The album cover features an abstract rendering of Sheeran’s portrait, loosely resembling the shape of a heart. Subtract is the fourth and final album in a series of mathematics-inspired releases, and it is seen as Sheeran’s most vulnerable and touching album to date, featuring music that Sheeran describes as “honest and true” to where he was in life during the recording. This honest self-expression carries itself through the design of the album’s namesake watch. The G-SHOCK Ref. 6900 - Subtract by Ed Sheeran features a resin case and strap dominated by a bold and bright yellow - certainly a daring color, but one that works surprisingly well on the wrist. The strap is adorned with black watercolor splatters that pull inspiration from the album's peripheral artwork and includes a black strap keeper. Solid black is further used across the case, indicating the Mode and Start/Stop indicators and the Adjust and Split/Reset indicators. The same yellow &amp; black colorway was applied to the illuminator button at the base of the dial. And this is where things get really interesting. The entire dial is the abstract interpretation of Ed’s face, as well as a sketched subtraction sign at 12 o'clock, as seen on the Subtract album cover. It pulls in muted reds, oranges, greens, and blues, which help to balance the bright yellow of the case. The iconic G-SHOCK “Triple Graph” display features yellow surrounds - a subtle way to pull the colors from the case into the dial. The watch is shipped in G-SHOCK’s round tin, and the packaging artwork feels like you are holding a 3-D interpretation of the Subtract album. Inside the box, you’ll find a personal note from none other than John Mayer himself. The G-SHOCK Ref. 6900 - Subtract by Ed Sheeran is unlike anything we have ever released - and we are thrilled to see Ed carry on the legacy of our past collaborations with G-SHOCK."

This analog-digital combination watch delivers more comfortable fit and outstanding durability with a robust exterior incorporating a guarding structure built with metal components. The watches of the G-SHOCK Master of G line, developed for professionals working in the harshest environments, come equipped with even tougher functionality. And the MUDMASTER takes this even further with the ability to handle the roughest on-land environments, earning the appreciation and trust of rangers and rescue teams operating in extreme environments. The comfortably sized GWG-B1000 features a metal exterior crafted with high-precision forging techniques and a carbon fiber-reinforced resin case that offers high strength and outstanding durability. Radio-controlled and solar-powered, the watch is also equipped with a triple sensor that keeps you updated with direction, altitude, barometric pressure, and temperature readings. Double LED lights and sapphire crystal ensure high readability so you always see the time and other readings, no matter what the conditions are like. Input a specific location in the app and the Location Indicator function moves the indicator hand at the 3 o’clock position to point in that direction so you stay on track at all times — even when visibility is obstructed by extreme conditions like sandstorms. The use of bio-based resins for the case, some bezel components, and the band make for a watch that demonstrates the MUDMASTER commitment to the environment."

    "watch_description": "Enjoy both fearless adventure and a comfortable fit with this tough and rugged Master of G Mudmaster flagship timepiece. This analog-digital combination watch delivers more comfortable fit and outstanding durability with a robust exterior incorporating a guarding structure built with metal components. The watches of the G-SHOCK Master of G line, developed for professionals working in the harshest environments, come equipped with even tougher functionality. And the MUDMASTER takes this even further with the ability to handle the roughest on-land environments, earning the appreciation and trust of rangers and rescue teams operating in extreme environments. The comfortably sized GWG-B1000 features a metal exterior crafted with high-precision forging techniques and a carbon fiber-reinforced resin case that offers high strength and outstanding durability. Radio-controlled and solar-powered, the watch is also equipped with a triple sensor that keeps you updated with direction, altitude, barometric pressure, and temperature readings. Double LED lights and sapphire crystal ensure high readability so you always see the time and other readings, no matter what the conditions are like. Input a specific location in the app and the Location Indicator function moves the indicator hand at the 3 o’clock position to point in that direction so you stay on track at all times — even when visibility is obstructed by extreme conditions like sandstorms. The use of bio-based resins for the case, some bezel components, and the band make for a watch that demonstrates the MUDMASTER commitment to the environment."

    "watch_description": "Celebrating four decades of G-SHOCK and a long-standing partnership with Livestock, this limited edition DW6900 is more than just a timepiece — it's a tribute to an era and a lifestyle. The Livestock x G-SHOCK DW6900 is inspired by the infamous highway that encircles Tokyo, known as the \"Bayshore Route.\" In the 1990s, the highway became an illegal high-stakes circuit for highly modified street cars at night. The watch’s design includes the highway’s symbol on the strap, a race-inspired face cluster, Japanese dial instructions and a laser-etched tachometer. Beyond its compelling backstory and design elements, the watch is also engineered for durability and functionality — boasting a robust resin construction and an array of signature features for everyday use. Altogether, it's a collector's dream, designed for watch and car enthusiasts alike while commemorating G-SHOCK's enduring legacy."

    "watch_description": "Celebrating the story of G-SHOCK, a truly unique watch whose pioneering innovation, function, and versatile design has made it a cult-collectible worn by devoted fans across the globe as well as by cultural icons in the worlds of fashion, sports, music, and popular culture for the past forty years. Born at a time when watches were generally considered fragile instruments, G-SHOCK began as a dream of a young engineer, Kikuo Ibe, who wanted to create “a watch that doesn’t break even when dropped.” In 1981, Project Team Tough was formed to build it, and over two years and 200 prototypes later, the indestructible, shock-resistant G-SHOCK watch was crafted. This revealing volume takes readers through the journey, spirit, and evolution of this distinctive timepiece, whose form and function combined with constant innovation over the past four decades have cemented the watch as a symbol of strength and endurance. Worn by everyone from pro-athletes and military personnel, to skateboarders, surfers, musicians, and entertainers, this stylish and multipurpose watch has permeated the spheres of sports, design, music, and popular culture. Chapters include a history of the technological innovation, behind-the-scenes imagery from the brand’s R&amp;D Facilities in Japan and advertisements and collaborations with sports figures, fashion designers, musicians, and artists including pro-surfer Kanoa Igarashi, musician Kid Cudi, designers Takashi Murakami and Nigo, as well as fashion brands like BAPE, Kith, Stüssy, Maison Margiela, and Supreme.&nbsp; Embodying the spirit of “Absolute Toughness,” G-SHOCK’s visceral connection to its collaborators and collectors make this book a must-have for watch connoisseurs and design aficionados. About The Author Ariel Adams has been wearing Casio watches since the mid-1980s. In 2007 he founded the major online timepiece magazine aBlogtoWatch.com, which is a leading publication dedicated to enthusiasm for all watches. Ariel Adams is also an internationally recognized expert on wristwatches and the modern industry that creates them. Photography by Atom Moore."

Marking G-SHOCK’s 40th anniversary and IN4MATION’s 20th anniversary, the inspiration for the new “Mosh Pit” timepiece came as a result of a mash-up of three of the most revered collaborations between the two brands, the Sea Foam, Salmon, and Purple Rain colorways. The new, reimagined model fuses G-SHOCK’s iconic DW5600 design with the bold color pallet of IN4MATION’s renowned style. The DW5600IN4M234 is built on the iconic square DW5600 silhouette, serving as a canvas for IN4MATION’s artistic expression. The classic “hi” symbol, which appears when the backlight is activated, is a nod to the brand’s heritage along with the IN4MATION logo on the back case and band that marks the shared creativity for this collaboration. IN4MATION, rooted in Hawaiian surf culture, combined with G-SHOCK’s relentless pursuit of durability and innovation, set the stage for a unique partnership more than 15 years ago, and is one that continues to resonate deeply with streetwear enthusiasts across the globe today."

The GWG-2000CR dial, bezel, and band feature a bold cracked pattern inspired by the demanding ground it helps you cover. Ion plated in black, then laser engraved and subjected to an aging process, the bezel evokes mud-crack formations. The cracked pattern on the band is achieved with all-over printing and heat treatment to create a textured surface with extra depth and dimension. This shock-resistant watch is constructed to withstand all the mud and sand your adventures can bring while also delivering an even more comfortable fit. The compact design is made possible by the forged carbon bezel, Carbon Core Guard case structure, and mud-resist buttons combined with stainless steel pipes and silicone buffers. Finely powdered carbon fiber is kneaded into resin, then heat-pressed to mold a MUDMASTER bezel that is more complex and intricate, yet even stronger than before. Triple sensor measurements keep you updated with direction, altitude, barometric pressure, and temperature readings. Large numbered indexes, extra-thick arrow-shaped hands, double LED lights, and sapphire crystal ensure high visibility."

    "watch_description": "Feel the pure rush of a formula race car tearing up the track, with the EDIFICE WINDFLOW ECB-2200P, a digital-analog combination chronograph inspired by the racetrack. The side view, designed to evoke a sense of the wind flowing through a fender-pontooned formula race car, and the sharp, dimensional mechanical face present a unique look of sheer speed. The carbon fiber reinforced resin case lends strength, but keeps the watch lightweight for a very wearable design. The four openings on the band evoke the look of sports cars’ air vents and serve to enhance breathability when wearing the watch. It’s a snap to sync with your smartphone via Bluetooth®. Tap into the app to access functions that are so important for racing teams — get automatically adjusted to-the-second precision timekeeping, effortlessly manage world time, transfer stopwatch data measured to the millisecond for up to 200 lap times to your smartphone, and use Super Illuminator to light up the analog face. Tough Solar can charge the watch from sunlight or even fluorescent lamp light, storing enough power for up to 7 months of normal use. The scratch-resistant sapphire crystal delivers durability that can withstand the inevitable bangs and scrapes car mechanics experience."

The G-SHOCK Master of G line of watches developed for professionals working in the harshest environments introduces the triple-sensor MUDMAN with mud-resist construction. The large, easy to operate front button and three direct sensor buttons on the side are shaped to drain mud and water and are protected by cylinder-shaped stainless steel components. The button shafts are equipped with gasket fittings to keep mud and dust out, as well, so you’re ready to take on the toughest of terrains. The bold design features a dual-layer LCD, as well as the Triple Sensor to deliver altitude, direction, temperature and barometric pressure readings directly to your wrist. The thin module and Carbon Core Guard structure mean all these features live in a slimmer, more compact watch, for tough and rugged support with a comfortable fit. Slim, yet powerful, this MUDMAN design packs full-on functionality in a striking exterior built with an intricate combination of components. The digital compass is more practical than ever thanks to the dual-layer LCD, which displays compass graphics on the top layer and time and other readings on the layer below. The GW-9500-3 and GW-9500-1A4 feature a negative dual-layer LCD. Taking utility to a whole new level, radio-controlled solar power delivers precision timekeeping powered by light, while Super Illuminator ensures visibility, even in dark places. The case, bezel and urethane band are made with bio-based resins derived from renewable organic resources. The case back is engraved with the iconic MUDMAN mole character holding a compass."

The case back features the Eric Haze-designed 40th logo, and the band loop is engraved with four stars in a nod to this special anniversary. These details and the first-ever use of a see-through case made of clear glass fiber diamide deliver a singular design worthy of an exceptional limited-edition G-SHOCK. The new lineup includes watches modeled after multiple iconic G-SHOCK timepieces: the very first G-SHOCK, the DW-5000; the classic digital DW-5600; the DW-6900 with distinctive front button design; or the GA-2100/GMA-S2100 or the GA-110/GMA-S110, which can be worn on their own or as part of a matching set.

See-through materials for the band, case, dial, LCD, and buttons provide a behind-the-scenes view of the module substrate printed with the G mark and G-SHOCK logo. The case back features the Eric Haze-designed 40th logo, and the band loop is engraved with four stars in a nod to this special anniversary. These details and the first-ever use of a see-through case made of clear glass fiber diamide deliver a singular design worthy of an exceptional limited-edition G-SHOCK. The new lineup includes watches modeled after multiple iconic G-SHOCK timepieces: the very first G-SHOCK, the DW-5000; the classic digital DW-5600; the DW-6900 with distinctive front button design; or the GA-2100/GMA-S2100 or the GA-110/GMA-S110, which can be worn on their own or as part of a matching set.

Craftsmanship, legacy, and innovation make G-SHOCK synonymous with quality, and through the Oneness collaboration, this connection becomes even more apparent. Attention to detail is visible throughout with the straps of the watch showing off a gradient colorway print spanning from amber to deep reddish brown to represent the look of Kentucky bourbon. The bezel is clear resin, and the timepiece features gold IP (ion plating) on the buttons and buckle for an elevated touch. To further highlight the collaboration, the Oneness logo is engraved on the case back, and can also be found on the face of the watch with the quote, “What Are You Waiting On.” Limited to a select number of pieces, the G-SHOCK x Oneness DW5600ONS234 is a collector’s dream and a must-have for enthusiasts of both brands, as well as those of Kentucky bourbon. As with all G-SHOCK collaborations, the timepiece comes in bespoke packaging reminiscent of your favorite bourbon, along with a fabric bag and branded stand display, making it an exceptional keepsake for those who appreciate the fusion of fashion, street culture, and a Kentucky classic. This project marks a first for the two brands, who have long been partners, and the G- SHOCK team is thrilled to be a part of this historic rollout with ONENESS as part of the ongoing celebration of G-SHOCK’s 40th anniversary."

    "watch_description": "Discover innovative form of great structural beauty, MT-G timepieces born of an entirely new design concept combining the resin used in the first G-SHOCK models with metal materials. Welcome to a whole new level of sophisticated structural design. With its even more advanced Dual Core Guard structure, the MTG-B3000 protects the module in a carbon fiber-reinforced resin case and encloses the exterior in metal components. Repeated pressing, cutting, and polishing builds the stainless steel case back upward into an intricate 3D form. The case back also serves as the lugs to secure the band and as the guards for crown and buttons, for a completely new structure. Using high-density mounting technology, we developed a new slimmer, multi-function module. All of these innovative designs and technologies created a much thinner watch, measuring just 12.1 mm from bezel to case back. MT-G innovation extends even to the band. All-new one-touch exchange structure eliminates the need for special tools. Simply press the buttons located on the sides of the lugs to quickly and easily swap out the band. The MTG-B3000 features an even lighter layered composite band made of stainless steel and fine resin. Its stainless steel bezel is ion plated in gold color, then treated with a hairline finish to expose the stainless steel below the convex surfaces only. These meticulous details come together to offer an intricate and sophisticated design. The high-transparency sapphire crystal paired with the delicate molding and vapor deposition of Yamagata Casio’s microfabrication technology adds final touches of sophistication and quality. This innovative, tough new style delivers full-on functionality, as well. Download the CASIO WATCHES app to pair with your smartphone via Bluetooth®. With Multiband 6, Tough Solar charging system, and high-brightness LED light, these timepieces keep you at peak performance, whatever your adventures may bring."

    "watch_description": "Celebrate two anniversaries in premium style with a limited-edition MR-G FROGMAN that marks the G-SHOCK 40th and the FROGMAN 30th anniversary. The timepiece comes with both a Dura Soft fluoro rubber band in the limited-edition yellow used for the original FROGMAN model and a striking bracelet-type band in titanium. Easily swap out the band using the dedicated mounting tool that comes with the set to remove the side pins while pressing the buttons on the lugs' undersides. Raised index marks are carefully hand-painted with a generous layer of glow-in-the-dark yellow paint for the outstanding visibility you need underwater. The screw-lock case back, fit with sapphire crystal finished in gold vapor deposition, is engraved with the iconic FROGMAN diving frog character. This 30th anniversary model is based on the MRG-BF1000, a premium, full-metal G-SHOCK MR-G timepiece for the sea. Titanium-clad, airtight with ISO 200-meter water resistance, the MRG-BF1000E joins the FROGMAN family of full-fledged diver’s watches with meticulous attention to detailed perfection. Its unique asymmetrical design, screw-lock case back and distinctive diving frog character — which were so popular when FROGMAN came out back in 1993 — take the diver’s watch to a whole new level. The resin originally used for the complex design of the first FROGMAN is replaced with titanium. Each component is crafted separately and polished meticulously to bring luxe MR-G quality to the FROGMAN line of diver's watches. Pure titanium is treated with a deep-layer hardening process, DLC coating and gold-colored ion plating for even greater strength. An intricate combination of over 70 exterior components, the case includes an O-ring waterproof seal to deliver outstanding FROGMAN water resistance and special buffers to strengthen the shock-resistant structure. For enhanced strength, we’ve developed a protective structure with fluoro rubber buffers installed between the multiple bezel parts. This structure features face-guarding functionality that helps to absorb shocks from the front and the sides, as well as protecting the crystal — all while maintaining the beauty in form of the MR-G line."

Each timepiece is a one-of-a-kind, thanks to the unique differences in crystalline grains*1 and rainbow IP colors.*2 Elaborate finishing takes this timepiece to an entirely other level. The case back, made of stainless steel treated with rainbow IP, is then repolished to remove the coated layer from only the raised portions on the back of the case. The mysteriously beautiful aurora borealis colors are also captured in the new purple hue of the translucent soft urethane band paired with the rose gold-colored ion-plated band loop and purple ion-plated buckle. The MTGB3000 design invites you to join the dance of color in the aurora borealis as seen from outer space. *1 The stainless steel is processed into components and then recrystallized, yielding unique differences in crystalline grain that make for subtle differences in pattern, color tone, and luster from part to part. *2 The look of the rainbow ion-plating color will vary from watch to watch."

The limited-edition timepiece perfectly fuses together the toughness of G-SHOCK with the minimalist, yet colorful design elements that Anti Social Social Club is known for. The DW6900ASSC23 comes to life through the classic design of the DW6900, which was first introduced in 1995. As G-SHOCK celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, the call back to such an influential and well-loved style through a collaboration with Anti Social Social Club brings together fans of both brands to celebrate the unique, durable and fashionable new timepiece. Highlighted by a matte black resin case, bezel, and band, the sunset-like face pays homage to Anti Social Social Club’s Los Angeles roots, making it the perfect accessory for the summer season. The vibrant pink, yellow, and orange colors on the face are featured throughout the watch on the bezel, as well as the band in a gradient colorway, which features the brand’s logo and slogan."

More than just a revival, the redesign evolves with a focus on reducing environmental footprint. Earth-friendly bio based resins are used in the bezel and band, and the Tough Solar feature is powered by a solar panel designed especially to complement the shape of the DW-8200 dial. For this very special 30th anniversary design, the popular diving frog so familiar to FROGMAN fans is engraved on the case back and displayed with the LED backlight."

This MR-G diver’s watch takes the unique asymmetrical design, screw-lock case back and distinctive diving frog character — which were so popular when FROGMAN came out back in 1993 — to a whole new level. Originally produced in resin, the complex design has now been remade in titanium, with each component crafted separately and polished meticulously for an entirely new feel of high-end quality. The watch is built with an intricate combination of over 70 exterior components, including an O-ring waterproof seal to deliver outstanding FROGMAN water resistance and special buffers to strengthen the shock-resistant structure — all while maintaining the beauty of form the MR-G line is known for. For enhanced strength, we’ve developed a protective structure with fluoro rubber buffers installed between the multiple bezel parts. This structure features face-guarding functionality that helps to absorb shocks from the front and the sides, as well as protecting the crystal. The dedicated MR-G module features a gold-plated retainer plate. The screw-lock case back is fit with sapphire crystal finished in vibrant blue vapor deposition and engraved with the iconic FROGMAN diving frog character. Dura Soft, a durable and comfortable fluoro rubber, is used for the band, and Ti64 titanium alloy for the buckle and band loop. Simply remove the side pins while pressing the buttons on the lugs’ undersides to quickly and easily swap out the band. More than just handsome, this timepiece provides superior functionality, as well. Equipped with Bluetooth®, the hour and minute hands overlap and work in unison to form a single hand when in diving mode, making the time spent underwater (minutes) easy and intuitive to see and delivering high visibility. Download the dedicated app to pair with your smartphone and easily display tide data for more than 3,000 locations around the world. Check dive logs on your smartphone and get more details on data tracked by your watch."

We mark this anniversary with the GMWB5000PG — an addition to the line of GMWB5000 full-metal takes on the very first G-SHOCK, the DW5000, which debuted 40 years ago in April 1983. The limited-edition timepiece is clad in recrystallized and deep-layer hardened stainless steel developed with this run in mind. Following recrystallization and deep-layer hardening, the bezel and band are treated with gold ion plating and the screw-lock case back with DLC coating for a bold, radiant look. In a special nod to the DW5000, the dial features the phrase “SINCE 1983.” The case back is engraved with the Eric Haze-designed 40th logo, and the lower left button is engraved with a star, for a timepiece that crystallizes the G-SHOCK 40th anniversary celebration. *The stainless steel is processed into components and then recrystallized, yielding unique differences in crystalline grain. This makes the pattern, color tone, and luster differ subtly from part to part."

The shock-resistant structure stands up to bumps and scrapes, and water resistance up to 200 meters means you can even swim with it on."

The stainless steel bezel — formed three-dimensionally through a time-consuming forging, cutting, and polishing process — is finished beautifully with a circular hairline treatment on the top surface and mirror polish on the slopes. Pairs with a smartphone via Bluetooth®. Simply tap into the dedicated app for precision timekeeping that keeps you on track. With Tough Solar, a high-brightness LED light and a range of other convenient functions, this is a timepiece that delivers on style and practical utility."

Marking the 50th anniversary of its 1972 launch this year, Y’s is a brand that crafts high-quality fashion with universal values and unique pattern-making techniques. The GM-S5600YS-1 begins with the GM-S5600, the more compact version of the iconic octagonal G-SHOCK that features a metal bezel. This timepiece comes with an additional custom-made cloth band that can be swapped with the resin band to suit the mood and style of the day. For added functionality, the cloth band includes a cover to protect the watch face. The cover can be pulled back, folded through the buckle, and easily fastened in place with Velcro. The woven label listing model number and watch functions is sewn at the top edge of the cloth band as a graphic design element inspired by the woven label sewn into Y’s brand clothing. Like the Y’s line, this band is also carefully designed to be durable and comfortable to wear. The all-black body carries on the Y’s style and is accented with metal components for a refined look. Each part of the timepiece is carefully polished with a different finish — the buckle and case with a honing finish; the bezel top with a hairline finish; and the side buttons and screws with a mirror finish. The dial and case back feature the Y’s logo. Y’s Y’s is designer Yohji Yamamoto’s very first brand, and to this day it bears his vision and philosophy. The concept at the root of the brand is women wearing men’s clothing, and Y’s creates pieces for independent women who value their own timeless vision. Each piece of functional, refined everyday wear in the brand’s unique clothing category is shaped by universal values and unique pattern-making techniques. The brand values the importance of “the space between the garment and the body” to emphasize airiness, volume, and balance, employing careful cutting and meticulous selection of materials to achieve a refined silhouette. The Atelier team that carries on the Yamamoto philosophy continues to present Y’s unique brand identity: functional, elegant, prêt-à-porter daily wear."

Evolved from the G-SHOCK original design that was born in 1983, the GW5000U-1 is a discerning model that boasts technology and a high-quality finish."

    "watch_description": "With plans changing all the time, weather waiting for no one, and your look evolving as the day goes on, wearing a watch can feel like a trust fall for your wrist - serving as the only thing keeping you grounded as you go about your business. And though every watch will relay the information you need to know, some are just better at telling the story. To commemorate G-Shock's 40th Anniversary, the Bodega x G-SHOCK DW5600 delivers a faithful take on their 'quintessential' model, updated to fit our vision of an everyday watch that can tick with the very best. Grounded in its shock, water, and Triple G resistant technology and signature shape, our 5600's rugged features ensure it will never miss a tock. Decked out in a retro face complete with co-branding, globe graphics, red &amp; blue striping, and maybe a secret backlight reveal, the watch is directed by nostalgia but tuned for today. Complete with an alternative woven Bodega band with carabineer closure and ammo box inspired case with custom co-branding, this resin watch is ready to go, anytime &amp; anywhere."

The pattern is rendered in black ion plating and laser engraving, which is applied both before and after the ion plating to create the impression of shading for a pattern of depth and dimension. Made with TranTixxii® titanium alloy developed by Nippon Steel Corporation, this timepiece delivers titanium’s lightweight comfort against the skin, and roughly twice the surface hardness of conventional titanium, for a mirror-finish beauty comparable to stainless steel.

This collaborative design begins with the GA-2100 and its octagonal bezel, incorporating translucent components to the base gray for a monochromatic, futuristic style. A gold indicator hand and the colors of the French flag (blue, white and red) adorn the small inset dial at 9 o’clock as striking accents. A simple, always-fresh design that never grows old — everything you want from a collaboration between a well-loved street fashion brand and the rugged G-SHOCK. FUTUR FUTUR was started by Felix Schaper and Benoit Fredonie in July 2014. Coming from two different backgrounds, — one from skateboarding, the other from apparel, FUTUR became a brand focused on polished aesthetics rooted in skateboarding with a high quality touch."

The first-ever FROGMAN made quite a splash when it launched back in 1993. The second limited edition to commemorate the 30th FROGMAN anniversary in 2023 takes the GWFA1000 to a whole new level, with a special design inspired by the poison dart frog. The multicolor carbon bezel evokes the mysterious hues of this rare species of colorful frog living in the South American Amazon. Cut from a base material of colorful carbon and glass fibers laminated in random patterns, no two bezels are exactly alike, reflecting the rarity of this frog species. The combination of strikingly colorful bezel and translucent urethane reproduces the look and feel of the water-loving poison dart frog. The band is printed with polarized ink to evoke the speckled pattern of a frog — a touch repeated on the case back with the iconic frog character reimagined as a poison dart frog."

Blue vapor deposition is applied to the entire dial, pink gold IP is applied to the hour character at 12 o'clock, and pink gold is vapor deposited to the edge of the crystal. In addition, OCEANUS’ signature blue color is applied to the bezel. In addition to correcting the time via standard radio wave reception function, it is equipped with a time adjustment function through smartphone link. In correspondence with world time (approximately 300 cities), users can automatically change the time zone and summer time. A slim case with a thickness of 9.7 mm yields a thin and beautiful form, and is a high-quality OCEANUS Manta that combines functionality and design."

Celebrate New Year 2023, the Year of the Rabbit, with this very special MT-G timepiece combining original G-SHOCK resin with metal in an innovative form and design inspired by the “rabbit in the moon.” The bezel, forged for texture and coated with gold ion plating to evoke the surface of the moon, is complemented by the lunar pattern on the dial. The case back is engraved with a playful illustration of a rabbit traveling to the moon, for an added whimsical touch. The MTGB3000 features a Dual Core Guard structure, which protects the module in a carbon-reinforced resin case and encloses the exterior in metal components. Repeated pressing, cutting, and polishing builds the stainless steel case back upward into an intricate 3D form. The case back also includes the lugs to secure the band and the guards for crown and buttons, for a completely new structure and a more compact, slimmer timepiece.

This G-SHOCK stays true to the trilogy’s inspiration of classic 1980s Casio keyboards. The DW6900JM22-2 features a matte dusty blue case and strap, a more playful color combination that’s an excellent companion to the first two collaborations. Peach, coral, and turquoise from the PT-1 keyboard were brought in to highlight the “Triple Graph” display, which sits right at home in the soft cream dial. Darker grey was pulled from the sharp and flat keys of the PT-1 keyboard and added to the illuminator button. All four indicators for the buttons share the navy color from the writing on the PT-1, a perfect accent on the lighter blue background. The DW6900JM22-2 gives you both the toughness you expect from a G-SHOCK with a colorway that will make your inner creative child smile. When it’s all said and done, this G-SHOCK stays true to the trilogy’s inspiration of classic 1980s Casio keyboards.

Indulge your senses with the innovative form of superior structural beauty — an MT-G timepiece that combines original G-SHOCK resin with metal for an entirely new design concept. Accented in gold hues, the MTGB3000BDE comes with two interchangeable bands: a lighter weight, layered-composite band made of stainless steel and fine resin, and a soft urethane band with band loop and buckle ion-plated in gold. The all-new one-touch exchange structure eliminates the need for special tools. Simply press the buttons located on the sides of the lugs to quickly and easily swap out the band. With its even more advanced Dual Core Guard structure, MTGB3000 watches protect the module in a carbon-reinforced resin case and enclose the exterior in metal components. Repeated pressing, cutting, and polishing builds the stainless steel case back upward into an intricate 3D form. The case back also serves as the lugs to secure the band and as the guards for crown and buttons, for a completely new structure. Using high-density mounting technology, we developed a new slimmer, multi-function module. All of these innovative designs and technologies created a much thinner watch, measuring just 12.1 mm from bezel to case back. This innovative, tough new style delivers full-on functionality, as well. Download the CASIO WATCHES app to pair with your smartphone via Bluetooth®. With Multi Band 6, Tough Solar charging system, and high-brightness LED light, this timepiece keeps you at peak performance, whatever your adventures may bring."

Bound into the future of tough, rugged watches with this signature timepiece inspired by professional basketball player Rui Hachimura. This collaboration begins with the distinctive triple graph and front button design of the DW6900. Then take the bezel and band to Toyama, where Hachimura was born, with a bold print of the Tateyama mountains in ice blue and white, inspired by the melting snow of the Japan Alps. The case back is engraved with Hachimura’s personal logo, which incorporates the Japanese character for 8 (八) representing both his name and jersey number. Press the front button to activate the EL backlight and see his logo appear on the dial, as well. The shock-resistant structure and intrepid design deliver an edgy, sporty design as athletic and fashionable as Hachimura himself."

Every element of the design of this watch is fun and playful, which is perfectly matching the HARIBO world. Its basic white semi-transparent material is accented by the colors of the popular Goldbears. The base model is the petite BABY-G BG169. The buttons and face of the watch are decorated with colors inspired by the HARIBO Goldbears. The entire surface of the face is decorated with iconic silhouettes of the HARIBO Goldbears featuring the tastes of raspberry, lemon, strawberry and orange. Turning on the watch's EL backlight also displays a pattern of HARIBO Goldbears shapes that align with the fixed pattern on the face. The band and case of this model are made of matte semi-transparent resin, which creates the same feel as gummy candy and complements the design's bright colors. A golden Goldbear icon is printed on the band ring, and the watch's back cover is engraved with the familiar Goldbear and HARIBO logo. The packaging of this model is also designed to reflect the gummy candy motif. Everything about the cute design of this special collaboration makes it a POP icon.

    "watch_description": "Introducing the ECB2000MFG — a one-of-a-kind high-performance motorsports watch designed in a very special EDIFICE collaboration with Shuichi Shigeno, the artist behind two landmark motorsports-themed manga series, Initial D and MF GHOST. Initial D features races through steep mountain passes. It ran from 1995 to 2013 in Young Magazine published by Kodansha Ltd., and is a fan favorite that has sold more than 56 million copies. MF GHOST, Shigeno’s street-based car racing manga, has appeared in the same magazine since 2017, with a television anime series set to premiere in 2023. This dream collaboration captures the worlds of Initial D and MF GHOST, with references to both incorporated throughout the design of this winner of a timepiece. The red and black design is based on the Toyota GT86 driven by MF GHOST protagonist Kanata Rivington. The base of the dial and the underside of the leather band are stamped with the characters Gyaaa (the sound of tires screeching across the roadway) that cut across the pages of both Initial D and MF GHOST. The underside of the band also features “Fujiwara Tofu Shop (Private Use),” the familiar lettering on the side of the Toyota AE86 driven by Takumi Fujiwara, the protagonist in Initial D. With Smartphone Link for effortless watch operation via Bluetooth®, and Tough Solar charging for power, this high-performance chronograph frees you to focus on the road ahead."

The case and resin case back are made with Bio-based resin, an eco-friendly, green material, in keeping with the PRO TREK commitment to coexisting harmoniously with nature. The newly developed flame-retardant leather band of the PRW6900YL holds up even when hit by flying sparks."

Combining OCEANUS blue and maki-e, the design concept is inspired by the natural beauty of waterfalls and is meant to express the dynamism of water. The sapphire crystal of the bezel is vapor-deposited with a gradation of blue to black, and the platinum “Makibokeshi Takimon” is drawn. All pieces are handmade by Mr. Shimode, so no two watches are the same. The dial uses a unique method inspired by “raden” to mimic the scene of water falling down while shining brightly with white mother of pearl shells. In terms of functions, it is equipped with standard radio wave reception function, smartphone link function, world time compatible function, etc. These high-performance functions are housed in a slim case with a thickness of 9.3 mm, and a thin and beautiful form has been achieved. High-quality OCEANUS Manta that combines functionality and design."

    "watch_description": "For those who truly appreciate the cutting edge of master craftsmanship — a limited edition 40th anniversary G-SHOCK collaboration watch featuring the stunning techniques of master swordsmith Sadanobu Gassan. Evoking the philosophy of the Japanese sword, the titanium band is crafted by Gassan to resemble a tang. This hidden, but pivotal part of the sword is traditionally marked with a yasuri-me pattern to keep the blade firmly in the handle. Gassan hand-carves the watch band with these marks and with 鍛 and 錬 inscriptions as a symbol of his family’s devotion to swordsmithing. This dedication to detail and excellence imbues each timepiece with a unique presence all its own. Casio introduces its all-new hybrid titanium bezel that evokes the look of the Gassan family’s signature ayasugi-hada patterns. This newly developed titanium is crafted with recrystallized layers of pure and Ti64 titanium, a process overseen by Gassan himself to capture the true beauty of a sword blade’s temper patterns. The blue-gray bezel, band and case back, finished in the most recent addition to Casio color ion plating technology, express the blue-tinged ferrous coloration that is the mark of a finely crafted sword. Recrystallized pure titanium for the case features a distinctive crystallized pattern treated with a deep-layer hardening process and a titanium carbide finish for even greater strength and abrasion resistance. An engraved metal plate commemorating the G-SHOCK 40th anniversary at the 10 o’clock position adds a final touch of edgy styling. This truly special MR-G celebrates both the traditional artisanal techniques and cutting-edge technologies of Japan — all in a singular sword-inspired timepiece."

    "watch_description": "The GM6900WTC22-9 features Wu-Tang Clan’s iconic “Killer Bees” black and yellow color combination branded with their unmistakable “W” logo on the band and dial and “WU-TANG” displayed within the electro-luminescent backlight that illuminates with an afterglow. This model sports an elevated stainless steel black IP bezel -- an upgrade from the previous version -- that represents the evolution of both the hip-hop group and the 6900-case design. In addition to the “W” logo, one of Wu-Tang Clan’s most memorable lyrics, “Cash Rules Everything Around Me C.R.E.A.M.” is printed around the border of the black mirror-finished dial. Whether hanging around in the “Mysterious Land of Shaolin,” Staten Island, New York, where the group formed, or any other region, the impact of their music has a lasting presence due to the group’s influence on new rappers from the West Coast to the South. The GM6900WTC22-9 offers the absolute toughness you expect from a G-SHOCK and will remain a staple in street fashion, just as Wu-Tang Clan remains a household name in hip-hop."

Take the GMW-B5000 — the original full-metal take on the first-ever G-SHOCK, the DW-5000C — and add plenty of Eric Haze touches for a specially designed metal watch featuring the artist’s work, in ion-plating and laser engraving. The stainless steel band is ion-plated in black with Haze’s original graphics reproduced in laser-engraved patterns of dots. Small, medium, and large dots combine to create the impression of tonal shading in his characteristic graphic designs splashed across the entire band. The screw-lock case back, coated in diamond-like carbon (DLC), features a logo designed by Haze to commemorate the 40th anniversary of G-SHOCK. Press the light button to reveal Haze’s iconic logo and enjoy the fade-in/fade-out effect. The watch comes in special packaging adorned with the commemorative anniversary logo designed by the artist himself for a stellar timepiece and incomparable 40th anniversary celebration. * Due to the screw-lock construction of the case back, the logo and lettering may not match up perfectly with the dial."

Individually and uniquely patterned bezel components — no two alike — result in truly one-of-a-kind lightweight watches of rugged strength.

    "watch_description": "Discover innovative form of great structural beauty, MT-G timepieces born of an entirely new design concept combining the resin used in the first G-SHOCK models with metal materials. Welcome to a whole new level of sophisticated structural design. With its even more advanced Dual Core Guard structure, the MTGB3000 protects the module in a carbon-reinforced resin case and encloses the exterior in metal components. Repeated pressing, cutting, and polishing builds the stainless steel case back upward into an intricate 3D form. The case back also serves as the lugs to secure the band and as the guards for crown and buttons, for a completely new structure. Using high-density mounting technology, we developed a new slimmer, multi-function module. All of these innovative designs and technologies created a much thinner watch, measuring just 12.1 mm from bezel to case back. The MTGB3000D features an even lighter layered composite band made of stainless steel and fine resin. Its stainless steel bezel is ion plated in black, then treated with a hairline finish to expose the stainless steel below the convex surfaces only. These meticulous details come together to offer an intricate and sophisticated design. This innovative, tough new style delivers full-on functionality, as well. Download the CASIO WATCHES app to pair with your smartphone via Bluetooth®. With Multi Band 6, Tough Solar charging system, and high-brightness LED light, these timepieces keep you at peak performance, whatever your adventures may bring."

A separate dial and LCD serve up analog beauty alongside digital performance. The LCD angles gently to follow the lines of the lugs, while the analog dial features simple bar index marks. The watch face adorned in a grid pattern adds the final touch for a real retro feel. The combination of the angular case and the straight links of the metal band is a simple and stylish celebration of structural beauty. More than just a fashion statement, these timepieces deliver practical functions like dual time, stopwatch, and alarm, as well as water resistance for daily use to free you from worry, even on rainy days."

The GA-2100HUF-5A commemorates the 20th anniversary of the HUF brand. This collaboration takes the popular octagonal GA-2100 in a new direction with inspiration from sneaker culture. Built with an eclectic combination of materials — from resin and metal components, to cloth for the band — the watch features a dial with touches of HUF’s signature lime-green and orange. The brand’s 20th anniversary logo is also engraved on the case back. In distinctive packaging inspired by the San Francisco streets, HUF has designed a timepiece that embodies the originality of its brand, with even the smallest of details bringing its unique worldview to life. HUF HUF was founded in 2002 by professional skateboarder Keith Hufnagel. Since its inception, HUF has evolved into an independent manufacturer of premium apparel, footwear, and skateboard goods, embodying the very countercultures from which it was conceived."

Edo-Kirko is the traditional Japanese art of glass craft that emerged in the late Edo period. The Edo-Kiriko sapphire crystal bezel is based on the design concept of \"There's a Certain Sliding Light\". The bezels are cut to express the beauty of light created by the delicate Japanese pattern \"Senji\". Blue-black gradation vapor deposition is applied to achieve this remarkable gradation. The 9.5 mm slim case highlights the thin and beautiful silhouette that only Manta can offer. In addition to time correction by the watch itself using Multi-Band 6 radio wave reception function, the watch is also equipped with a time correction function using a smartphone link via Bluetooth®. The watch can easily adjust to world time from approximately 300 cities and automatically change the time zone and daylight saving time. OCEANUS pursues high quality finishing down to the smallest detail, including dual-curved sapphire glass, and a titanium case and band that boast high wear resistance through titanium carbide treatment. Returns will only be accepted if product is in original packaging and protectant film is in place."

    "watch_description": "Welcome the MRGB5000, based on the first-ever G-SHOCK and crafted with the state-of-the-art metals and meticulous finishes that are the hallmark of the MR-G flagship line. These breakthrough timepieces are a study in metal craftsmanship. The case and bezel are made of Ti64-based super-hard titanium alloy, while the band is made of another special titanium alloy, DAT55G, that is both three times harder than pure titanium and highly workable. The bezel top is crafted in COBARION, a cobalt-chrome alloy four times harder than pure titanium. The bezel alone consists of 25 different components, each individually polished for a stunning detailed texture. The state-of-the-art Multi-guard Structure incorporates flat springs and silicone buffers into the multi-component bezel, ensuring outstanding shock absorption to protect the dedicated MR-G module with gold-plated retainer plate. Inspired by ink wash painting and calligraphy done in blue ink, the MRG5000BA features band screws and bezel components ion-plated in blue against a base of black diamond-like carbon coating. Touches of blue vapor deposition add bold interest to the watch face, and the iconic brick pattern is a nod to the original DW5000 G-SHOCK design. These metallic beauties deliver when it comes to function, too, with radio-controlled calibration and smartphone pairing via Bluetooth®."

For the first time in a PRO TREK or any Casio watch, the case and band are made from eco-friendly bio-based resin instead of conventional resins. The use of bio-based resin also delivers uncompromising resistance to hard use as well as comfort on the wrist. We are proud of this new material application for our line of premiere outdoor tools, PRO TREK. For optimal wear resistance and an airtight seal, the case back is made from high-strength engineered plastics made from bio-based materials. The case back has a wider flat surface, as well, for better torsional resistance. Dial contrast has been enhanced by using vivid white for the large bar indexes and hour and the minute hands, delivering optimum visibility in the field. The stainless steel bezel is engraved with city codes for an outdoor gear look. As the original function of the watch, it also has functions such as multi-band 6 and tough solar. It is a model packed with high functionality and practicality that correspond to various scenes in just size."

Honing finishes feature prominently on the bezel and band, with sides treated in a hairline finish and beveled band surfaces, screws and buttons treated in a mirror finish. The entire watch is then coated in black ion plating. Finally, the top surface of the bezel is polished once again in a hairline finish to expose nearly all of the stainless steel beneath the ion plating. Ion plating one shade lighter than conventional black integrates the re-exposed stainless steel of the bezel seamlessly into the overall design for a sophisticated, well-balanced, and singularly intriguing timepiece."

    "watch_description": "From the MR-G series, the pinnacle of the G-SHOCK lineup, comes a new design based on the original DW5000C. The trademark square shape is elevated by utilizing special, premium metal materials and artisan craftsmanship that the MR-G series represents. The new MRGB5000 model features an intricately shaped bezel made up of 25 parts that have been individually polished with Sallaz polishing, which gives the watch a stunning, elegant finish. A new shock-resistant multi-guard structure increases strength by using stainless steel leaf springs and silicon between bezel parts. The case and bezel are made of high-hardness Ti64 titanium alloy, and the band is made of DAT55G titanium alloy, which is approximately three times harder than pure titanium and provides excellent workability. The top of the bezel is made using the cobalt alloy COBARION®, which is approximately four times harder than pure titanium and has the same brilliance as platinum. The MRGB5000B-1 model enhances the mirror finish of the COBARION® material by adding a glossy finish with black DLC (diamond-like carbon), which is meant to resemble the original black DW5000C. A brick pattern and a red line for the frame around the digital display adorn the screen, which are identifying characteristics of the original DW5000C. Function-wise, the MRGB5000 also features a special-purpose MR-G module with gold-plated circuit retainer plates to reduce electrical resistance and is also equipped with time signal reception and Bluetooth® communication capabilities for smartphone connectivity. Returns will only be accepted if product is in original packaging and protectant film is in place."

These breakthrough timepieces are a study in metal craftsmanship. The case and bezel are made of Ti64-based super-hard titanium alloy, while the band is made of another special titanium alloy, DAT55G, that is both three times harder than pure titanium and highly workable. The bezel top is crafted in COBARION®, a cobalt-chrome alloy four times harder than pure titanium. The bezel alone consists of 25 different components, each individually polished for a stunning detailed texture. The state-of-the-art Multi-guard Structure incorporates flat springs and silicone buffers to the multi-component bezel, ensuring outstanding shock absorption to protect the dedicated MR-G module with gold-plated retainer plate. MRGB5000D with contrasting hairline and mirror finishes and a titanium carbide coating for exquisitely polished silver. Both watch faces feature an iconic brick pattern and red line in a nod to the original design. These metallic beauties deliver when it comes to function, too, with radio-controlled calibration and smartphone pairing via Bluetooth®."

The slim GSTB400 design is made possible by advances in component miniaturization and thinning of its modules, without sacrificing any Bluetooth® or solar functions. Power consumption has also been significantly reduced. In terms of design, the number of button guards has been reduced as much as possible, enabling the use of large stainless steel buttons that are slim yet easy to operate. The top bezel has been given five different finishes, while the middle bezel has been given four different finishes, which creates an elegant effect and changes the appearance of the texture of the metal depending on the viewing angle"

    "watch_description": "Introducing the second Rui Hachimura signature G-SHOCK. Bound into the future of tough, rugged watches with this signature timepiece inspired by professional basketball player Rui Hachimura. Breaking new ground in watch design with a metal forged bezel, this watch introduces a distinctive color palette to the base model — the metal-clad GM110 analog-digital combination — for a truly original timepiece. The design begins with the case, metal band loop, and buckle ion-plated in lustrous copper, and then adds yellow, green, and red, the national colors of Hachimura’s ancestral home of Benin, to the hands, dial and cloth band loops. Switch between watchbands — classic black to make the copper case really pop, or the truly special kente-cloth* motif. Hachimura’s personal logo, which combines the Japanese character for 8 (八) and a Japanese sword, is engraved on the metal band loop and the back of the watch case. *Kente-cloth: Kente are specially woven festive ritual cloths used in West Africa. Adorned with traditional proverbs and sayings, kente patterns boast a long cultural history."

The GSTB400X-1A4 sports a lightweight yet tough carbon bezel, which is a combination of carbon fiber reinforced resin and carbon sheets. This stylishly stealthy timepiece is styled with a black resin band and a black IP case with red accents. The GSTB400 is made possible by even further miniaturization of its parts and thinning of its modules without sacrificing any Bluetooth or solar function. Power consumption has also been significantly reduced. In addition, the carbon core guard structure of this model helps to make it the thinnest of the G-STEEL Series (as of Apr 2021) while maintaining a high level of impact resistance. The thickness from the back cover to the bezel top is only 12.9 mm, which is more than one millimeter less than the GSTB100 model. In terms of design, the number of button guards has been reduced as much as possible, enabling the use of large stainless steel buttons that are slim yet easy to operate."

Details on the watch glass hint at the exciting chase about to unfold as PAC-MAN, surrounded in the square LCD display ghost house, is poised to start running. Laser engraving on the black ion-plated metal band lays out the game maze. The game begins above the watch face with PAC-MAN eating dots as he runs away from the ghosts and continues below the face after he’s devoured a Power Pellet and turned back to chase them. Original game screen graphics are engraved on the case back. The packaging is designed to evoke the classic arcade machine through and through. Eat up this truly unique timepiece and bring the PAC-MAN spirit back to life! PAC-MAN™&amp;©BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc."

    "watch_description": "Tough and slim, the new GA2200 models have a carbon core guard structure that makes them great-looking outdoor tools. The GA2200M-4A comes in orange resin bezel and band with metallic accents and two layer dial. The slim, 12.8mm case of the GA2200 is created using a new structure that integrates the bezel, back cover, and buttons into a single piece. The six prominent screws securing the bezel create a G-SHOCK tough look. Enlarged side buttons provide a higher degree of impact resistance, eliminating the need for button guards. This creates a simple design and makes buttons easier to operate. A slide lever-type band makes band replacement quicker and simpler. The disc indicator on the face and the semi-circular design parts around it are colored using a vapor deposition process for a more realistic metallic feel. Each of these parts is separated from the dial for a three-dimensional effect. A diagonal digital display in the lower right of the face creates a unique look. The result is a collection of G-SHOCK models for young people and adults that look great in the great outdoors"

    "watch_description": "This OCEANUS Manta timepiece is based on the thin OCWS5000 and incorporates natural indigo, a traditional Japanese dye. The natural indigo produced in the Tokushima Prefecture, \"Awa Indigo\", is incorporated into the design as the foundation of OCEANUS' brand color, blue. In this model, the entire dial, except for the solar in-dial, is made of mother of pearl colored with natural Awa indigo through a precipitation method. For the in-dial, mother of pearl is used to express “Murakumo zome\", one of the indigo dyeing techniques, and the bezel is coated with blue IP. In terms of functions, in addition to Multi-Band 6 radio-controlled time correction by the watch itself by receiving standard radio wave signals, the watch is also equipped with Bluetooth® smartphone link for time /date updates. You can easily set the world time up to 300 cities and automatically change the time zone and daylight saving time. These advanced functions are housed in a slim 9.5 mm thick case with a beautiful form. Tradition and innovation. The OCEANUS Manta is a fusion of two Japanese prides. Returns will only be accepted if product is in original packaging and protectant film is in place."

    "watch_description": "The OCWS5000ME is based on the thin OCEANUS Manta and incorporates the traditional Japanese craft of maki-e into its design. Maki-e is a technique in which pictures and letters are drawn on the surface of lacquer ware using lacquer, and then gold or silver metal powder is sprinkled on the surface of the ware before it dries. This model was developed and manufactured by Mr. Yutaro Shimode, a traditional craftsman in Kyoto. The motif of this model is Mr. Shimode's masterpiece \"Whisper of Eternity,\" which expresses the sparkle of water using platinum. The dial and sapphire crystal bezel are decorated with platinum maki-e, the same technique used in his masterpieces. Since all the work is done by hand by Mr. Shimode, no two timepieces are alike. In terms of functions, in addition to time correction by the watch itself using Multi-Band 6 radio wave reception function, the watch is also equipped with a time correction function using a smartphone link via Bluetooth®. It can easily set the world time from about 300 cities and automatically change the time zone and daylight saving time. These advanced functions are housed in a slim 9.3 mm case that is also thin and beautiful. Tradition and innovation. The OCEANUS Manta is a fusion of two Japanese prides. Returns will only be accepted if product is in original packaging and protectant film is in place."

The kachi-iro design motif is a dark navy blue with a long history in Japan. Originally described as dark brown or dark indigo, it was favored by samurai as a \"winning color,\" and thus came to be used on armor and helmets. This model is based on the MRG-B2000 with a Japan motif on the dial to give it both beauty and strength. The base surface of the dial features a scaly pattern and its outer periphery is cut to resemble a fan or folding screen, creating a simple yet gorgeous texture. Additionally, the indices express the curvature of a Japanese sword via beautifully rendered edges and curved surfaces unique to Yamagata Casio's nano-processing technology. The inside of the bezel, inner dial, and logo are colored with kachi-iro to create a robust design. It also has the practical feature of linking to your smartphone via radio wave reception and Bluetooth® connectivity. Close attention was paid to the materials, structure, and features of this MR-G model, which inherits the strength and esthetics passed down in Japan since time immemorial."

    "watch_description": "A model from G-SHOCK's most luxurious line, MR-G, designed with the traditional Japanese kachi-iro color. The kachi-iro design motif is a dark navy blue with a long history in Japan. Originally described as dark brown or dark indigo, it was favored by samurai as a \"winning color,\" and thus came to be used on armor and helmets. This model is based on the MRG-B2000 with a Japan motif to give it both beauty and strength. Recrystallized titanium is used for the bezel to represent the tiny crystals, or nie, seen in the hamon of Japanese swords. The band is a softly textured yet durable Durasoft band to which a Bishamon tortoise shell pattern has been applied, as seen on Bishamonten's armor. Additionally, the base surface of the dial features a scaly pattern and its outer periphery is cut to resemble a fan or folding screen, while the indices represent the curvature of a Japanese sword via beautifully rendered curved surfaces. The inside of the bezel, inner dial, and logo are colored with kachi-iro to create a robust design. It also has the practical feature of linking to your smartphone via radio wave reception and Bluetooth® connectivity. Close attention was paid to the materials, structure, and features of this MR-G model, which inherits the strength and esthetics passed down in Japan since time immemorial."

Khaki and sand beige earth tone colored bands create the perfect look for outdoor gear timepieces. The orange and yellow colors used for the two front buttons and the inlaid bezel text were selected for their higher visibility. A dual-layer LCD that can simultaneously display different types of data combines with a register ring for simple bearing indication creates a practical design. The dual-layer liquid crystal makes it possible to show a blue compass pointer overlaid on the current timekeeping display, for outstanding versatility. The compass, barometric pressure/altitude, and temperature measurement functions, are powered by a Tough Solar system that keeps functions operating even with exposure to small amounts of light. The innovative arrangement of the large buttons that trigger compass, barometric pressure/altitude, and temperature measurement enable one-touch operation even when wearing gloves. Button guards encase the outside surfaces of the buttons with resin that prevents misoperation. In addition to being practical and highly functional, These PRG-240 models are also designed to go well with today’s outdoor fashions. • Triple Sensor: Bearing, barometric pressure/altitude, temperature • Tough Solar • Low-temperature specifications (–10℃/14℉) • 100-meter water resistance • Bearing bezel"

The 9.5 mm slim case highlights the thin and beautiful silhouette that only Manta can offer. In addition to time correction by the watch itself using Multi-Band 6 radio wave reception function, the watch is also equipped with a time correction function using a smartphone link via Bluetooth®. The watch can easily adjust to world time from approximately 300 cities and automatically change the time zone and daylight saving time. In terms of design, the watch features an all-black, colorway with DLC (diamond-like carbon) finish that is highly resistant to wear. A gradation from black to blue is used for the dial, and blue is used for the hour and minute hands. The 16-faceted polygonal bezel is unique to Manta, and the city code is written on the bezel to ensure high legibility with a clean face design. In addition, a curved line that flows from the case to the band creates an even more elegant silhouette. OCEANUS pursues high quality finishing down to the smallest detail, including dual-curved sapphire glass, Sallaz polishing, and a titanium case and band that boast high wear resistance through titanium carbide treatment. Returns will only be accepted if product is in original packaging and protectant film is in place."

The use of high rigidity carbon on the case keeps damage and deformation at bay, and ensures a high level of airtightness and shock resistance. This model also features a filter that protects against the invasion of mud, a stainless steel panel back, and a back cover made of shock-resistant fine resin embedded with glass fibers, giving it a high level of resistance to dust and mud. The bezel also uses three layers of fine resin with carbon fiber inserts and is designed to resemble a portable gasoline can that could be found on off-road vehicles. Function-wise, this model comes with compass, altimeter/barometer, temperature reader and pedometer. In addition to being able to easily correct the time using the dedicated CASIO WATCHES app, there are lots of other useful features including the Mission Log feature, which automatically records in the app altitude data obtained from the watch and route data obtained by your smartphone. This is a toughness watch that supports you in taking quick decisions and accurate actions."

Additionally, the two-layer structure of the back cover also guards against impacts to the back of the watch. The shock-proof button structure also allows the exterior to be designed without a button guard. The design features a three-dimensional dial and a bold arrangement of large front buttons.

    "watch_description": "This is a model from the G-Shock Mudmaster Series, designed for use in extreme environments scattered with rubble, dirt and debris, and uses carbon materials. The use of high rigidity carbon on the case keeps damage and deformation at bay, and ensures a high level of airtightness and shock resistance. This model also features a filter that protects against the invasion of mud, a stainless steel panel back, and a back cover made of shock-resistant fine resin embedded with glass fibers, giving it a high level of resistance to dust and mud. The bezel also uses three layers of fine resin with carbon fiber inserts and is designed to resemble a portable gasoline can that could be found on off-road vehicles. Function-wise, this model comes with compass, altimeter/barometer, temperature reader and pedometer. In addition to being able to easily correct the time using the dedicated CASIO WATCHES app, there are lots of other useful features including the Mission Log feature, which automatically records in the app altitude data obtained from the watch and route data obtained by your smartphone. This is a toughness watch that supports you in taking quick decisions and accurate actions."

    "watch_description": "G-SHOCK MOVE These are the latest additions to the G-SHOCK MOVE lineup of sports watches from G-SHOCK. These new models feature multi-segment digital displays to improve readability and operation while engaged in sports. The digital display is divided into upper, middle, and lower sections, and there is a digital dial in the upper right. Each display area shows different measurement, timekeeping, and other information, which provides useful data about your daily activities. These models come in a selection of fun sporty colors that are often used for sportswear, running shoes, and other sporting goods. A metal* front button and vapor deposition face add accent colors for striking designs. Function-wise, the watch links with the CASIO WATCHES phone app to provide access to a number of functions to support workouts. Daily health and fitness support functions include a 3-axis accelerometer that keeps track of your step count, a programmable that lets you create up to 20 timer combinations of five timers each, memory for up to 200 lap records, and more. The app also makes it possible to maintain step count logs with five exercise intensity levels, calculate the calories you burn, specify a daily step target, create timer combinations and send them to the watch, store stopwatch measurement data, view data, and more. All of this combines to help you plan and record your workouts, making them more effective and enjoyable. Other features include app-based auto time setting correction and other features for more efficient timekeeping, and an Auto LED Light (super illuminator) to facilitate workouts in areas where lighting is dim. Back wings on the inside of the bands where they connect to the case, a new band ring shape that prevents sliding, and more band holes to allow better tightness adjustment, all combine to allow fine adjustment of band length for a more comfortable fit. A mid-size design that's optimal for running and training, Bluetooth, phone app linking and much more make these new G-SHOCK MOVE models the perfect choice for sports and athleisure wear. • Phone Linking • Step Count Graph with five exercise intensity levels • Calories burned display • Combinable timers • Stopwatch measurement data log • Auto time adjustment (Four times a day) • Easy watch setting • World Time for approximately 300 cities • Time swapping • Alarm setting • Step count using a 3-axis accelerometer (Step Count Graph, step goal progress graphic) • Stopwatch with Target Time alarm (lap/split display switching, up to 10 Target Times, 200 lap time records) • Interval timer with up to five time settings (Auto repeat up to 20 times, skip, auto start, alert sound) • Super Illuminator with Auto light * Elegant looking and lightweight aluminum.

The GMW-B5000 Series has inherited its characteristic square design and been given the full metal treatment along with upgraded features including smartphone linking. The watch has been given a full-metal case by using a shock-resistant fine resin cushioning material inserted between the case and the sturdy stainless steel metal bezel. High-density mounting technology also allows the watch to maintain its size. The back of the watch features a solid Screw Lock Back and has been DLC treated for resistance to wear. The metal band has been dimple processed, inheriting the Resin Band design of the original. Visibility too has been enhanced via use of a film solar cell and STN-LCD (liquid crystal). Function-wise, this model comes with Bluetooth® communications and can link with a dedicated app to obtain precise time information. The watch is also packed with practical features including a time correction system that uses standard time and frequency signals (Multi-Band 6), a reliable source of power in the form of Tough Solar technology, high-luminance Full Auto LED backlighting, World Time and day of the week display in six languages. This is a G-SHOCK model that stays true to its predecessor while undergoing further refinement through the application of a full-metal design."

A dual-coil motor in a rotating disc dial placed at 9 o'clock moves the dial blades and exudes a functional beauty. In addition to the alarm on/off function and using the rotation to show the stopwatch, etc., it also functions as a battery indicator, contributing to a tough chronograph. The layer guard structure and high-density mounting technology have allowed the module to be smaller and thinner, improving wearability and overall watch quality. It is also equipped with Bluetooth® connectivity that enables accurate time acquisition via your smartphone. Its Tough Solar feature allows it to run stably, and it is also equipped with practical functions such as high-brightness LEDs and dual-dial world time."

It is said that the military commanders leading elite troops used this to show off the valor of their armies. Red has been a symbol of strength since ancient times, and is used throughout the bezel, the city code, and the dial of this model. Overlapping black and red, which are the G-SHOCK brand colors, represent an unparalleled strength that transcends time. This practical model is based on an MRG-B1000 equipped with the GPS hybrid radio solar system. Particular attention was also paid to every detail affecting strength and quality, as is reflected in the use of double-hardening processing, textured polishing, and an anti-reflective coating on the sapphire glass crystal. An MR-G with Japanese esthetics and technical capabilities thoroughly imbued with strength, beauty, and precision."

This model has been developed with operability in mind so that anyone can intuitively check their position using the Compass, even in the most extreme climates, without visual observation. The dust and mud-resistant button guard cylinder structure prevents fine sand and mud from getting into the buttons while also helping to absorb any shock to the buttons and improving operability.

The three-dimensionally arranged indices are painted with a glittering, metallic coat for a refined texture. This gives the watch a sharp and energetic impression. The side buttons are made easy to press and are thus more practical. The BABY-G, a watch with a complex mechanical dial that gives it personality and looks great on the street fashion scene."

Additionally, the direction, barometric pressure/altitude, and temperature measurement buttons are arranged independently. The large buttons can be operated with a single push, even with gloves on. The button guard also wraps the outer circumference of the buttons in a resin material to prevent mistakes during measurement. A resin band is provided at the joint between the case and band using large screws to improve the connection strength. The register ring is knurled to improve texture and to give the watch a sense of functionality and precision as a piece of outdoor gear."

These new models embody some of the very best in functional beauty and ease of operation that modern technology has to offer. • The rotary bezel is specially shaped for easy operation, even while wearing gloves. Large letters indicating north, south, east, and west are colored for easy reading. • Dedicated direction, barometer, and altitude buttons provide one-touch access to measurements. Buttons are large with slanted diamond patterns for plenty of slip resistance during operation. • Since \"easy to press\" often also means \"more operation error\", the back cover is designed to make it the same height of the button surfaces, which greatly reduces the chance of operation error. The result is easy button operation, but only when you need it to be. The number of pointer lines has been increased from 60 to 72 for easier to read World Time and sunrise times. TOUGH SOLAR ensures stable operation even when using power-hungry functions."
